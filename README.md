# Jank Client

Jank Client is a [Spacebar](https://spacebar.chat) client written in JS, HTML, and CSS.
To run it, clone the repo and run `npm install`, then `node index.js` to start the server.

Both [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) are supported, and should function as expected.

To access Jank Client after init, simply go to http://localhost:25512/login (or the port set in the ENV var `PORT`)
and register an account, or log in with your email and password.

You can view the current roadmap on https://github.com/users/MathMan05/projects/1.
